<h2>Circular Dendrogram</h2>
  <img src="viz3.png" alt="Circular Dendrogram">
<br />
<p>Circular dendrogram created on rawgraphs.io using data of fossils found by country, taken from paleobiodb.org. I chose to go with the circular dendrogram to depict it because it was the only graphy/chart option I found on the website that depicted the data in a way that I found as both aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand. Each "dendrite" is a different country and the size of the bulb at the top of it varies according to the number of fossils foudn in that country.</p>
