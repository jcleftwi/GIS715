<h2>Kosova and Serbia</h2>
  <img src="qgisKosovoAndSerbia.JPG" alt="Kosova and Serbia Image">
<br />
<p>The data for this image was taken from country shapefiles for Serbia and Kosova (Kosovo) obtained from gadm.org. The image does not show a boundary delineating Serbia from Kosova. The decision to create the image in this way was purely an aesthetic one. It was created using the topological coloring tool to ensure that no adjacent polygons are of the same color. From here, a duplicate of the original layer is created, and the shapeburst option was used to add the gradual fade of colors toward the inside of each polygon. The transparency of this layer is set to 25%.</p>

<h2>Hokkaido</h2>
  <img src="Hokkaido.png" alt="Hokkaido Image">
<br />
<p>The data used for this image was a country shapefile taken from gadm.org, which was used for the boundary. The glowing effect was produced by add both an outer and inner glow. A simple effect to create in QGIS, but the difficulty came in finding a color that didn't clash with the either the green of the land or the blue of the ocean, or appear to overbearing with the "neon" effect.</p>
